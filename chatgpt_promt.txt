TABLE "course_data" (
	"vocab_id"	INTEGER,
	"course_title"	TEXT,
	"week_title"	TEXT,
	"lesson_title"	TEXT,
	"phrases_type"	TEXT CHECK("phrases_type" IN ('vocabulary', 'dialogue')),

I need  mysql query to insert data from my raw data. 

MOST IMPORTANT, not skipped my chinese sentences and process them to insert to mysql too

And pinyin and english cannot be null or empty, ful fill them

There would be multiple lessons when I send you raw data, they are divided by:
============================================================================

Knowing that vocab_id is Primary key and increase automatically and phrases type can only be vocabulary or dialog

and current data have: course_title "hsk1", week_title "Family and school/university", lesson_title is still "lesson_{x}" with x is the number from 1, vocab id start from 83

Knowing that chinese field can only contain chinese language, pinyin and english field cannot be empty or null, find a way to fullfill them

I expect there would be 5 lessons
